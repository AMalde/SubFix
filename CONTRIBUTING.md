# Contributing to SubFix

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **SubFix**, a subtitle formatting tool built by and for indie filmmakers!

This project is open-source and evolving—feedback, ideas, and pull requests are all welcome.

## How to Contribute

### 🐞 Reporting Bugs
- Please [open an issue](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SubFix/issues) with clear steps to reproduce the problem.
- Include the platform you're on (e.g., macOS 12.6) and the type of subtitle file (.srt) you used.

### 💡 Feature Requests
Have an idea that would make this tool better? Open an issue and label it as a *feature request*. I'm especially interested in anything that helps streamline delivery to distributors.

### 🧑‍💻 Pull Requests
- Fork the repo and create a new branch.
- Please describe what the PR does and why it's useful.
- Keep code style consistent with the existing codebase.
- Add comments if you're doing something non-obvious or hacky—I'm still learning too!

## Notes on Current Features

SubFix currently:
- Adjusts subtitle timing
- Removes SDH tags (e.g., `[music]`, `(laughing)`)
- Normalizes durations
- Enforces formatting rules (like line count limits)
- Performs basic spellchecking

⚠️ It's not perfect! You should always proofread the final `.srt` file before delivery—especially if you’re submitting to a distributor.

## Roadmap Ideas

- ✅ SDH tag removal (basic)
- 🧠 Translator integration (in progress—currently stuck!)
- 🪟 Windows/Linux versions
- 🌍 More localization support
- 🎛️ GUI refinements

If you can help with any of the above, I’d love to collaborate.
